  - This function prints the duplicates.
  - I used the Hashset to make two lists , and hashmap to find the multiple orrurances. after that u sed two for loops to print only the duplicates.

  - This function will print fizz" is the number is divisible by 3, "buzz" is the number is divisible by 5 or
     "fizzbuzz" is the number is divisible by both
  - I used a for loop to loop through 100 times. and I used if else statements to decide if the number is divisible by 3, 5 or both

# Exercise 5 - Multiplicaton Array

  - This function prints a multiplication table from 1 to 10 using multidimensional array
  - I used a printTables function to print out the multiples and i used a for loop to determine where and when the multiples of the numbers should go.
